                <p>Hello to those who have stumble across this page.
                    This is a project in which I collect items and take photos of them to put into a 
                    web collection site.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                <p>The collection that I put is my past games that I used to play often in the Ds and 3Ds
                    game consoles. I have had fun memories and spent hours upon these games.
                    Most of which are animal and Pok√©mon games. If you view one of the images of
                    my games, you can click on them to see their description and one memorable event
                    I had with that selected game.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                <p>My hobbies are drawing, playing videogames, and reading mangas and manhuas.
                    Currently playing: Genshin Imapct</p>
